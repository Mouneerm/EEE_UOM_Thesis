Computer Vision algorithm implemented in a Raspberry Pi to monitor the performance of Public Transport in Mauritius


## Introduction to the problem:

Mauritius has experienced significant economic growth, but it has led to traffic congestion issues. The transport system lags due to an excessive number of vehicles, inefficient public transport, poor road traffic management, population growth, poor roadway conditions, economic development, urbanization, and unforeseen circumstances. Peak hours exacerbate the problem. Encouraging public transport use, especially buses, is a potential solution, but residents avoid buses due to the main following reasons:

1 . Slow driving in an attempt to maximise the number of potential passengers.

2. Safety concerns; accidents sometimes happen due to speeding

3. Unpredictable waiting times.

The proposed solution involves an Artificial Intelligence-powered camera system to assess bus speed and safety, coupled with a GPS system using the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time bus location information for passengers.

## System Architecture:

To solve the problems mentioned above, the propose system uses a single-board computer (SBC) or microcontroller along with sensors to record key bus traveling characteristics in realtime, such as speed, GPS coordinates and distance between vehicles in front. If the distance between the bus and the vehicle immediately in front of it is below the braking  distance, the driver will be penalized for dangerous driving while if the distance between both vehicles is too far and the bus is driving slowly for a certain amount of time, the driver will be warned and penalized for slow driving.
