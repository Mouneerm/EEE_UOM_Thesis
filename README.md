Computer Vision algorithm implemented in a Raspberry Pi to monitor the performance of Public Transport in Mauritius


## Introduction to the problem:

Mauritius has experienced significant economic growth, but it has led to traffic congestion issues. The transport system lags due to an excessive number of vehicles, inefficient public transport, poor road traffic management, population growth, poor roadway conditions, economic development, urbanization, and unforeseen circumstances. Peak hours exacerbate the problem. Encouraging public transport use, especially buses, is a potential solution, but residents avoid buses due to the following reasons:
1 . Slow driving 
2. afety concerns, unpredictable waiting times, inadequate buses during peak hours, hygiene issues (amid the Covid-19 pandemic), and lack of comfort. 
This theisis / repo is an attempt 
The proposed solution involves an Artificial Intelligence-powered camera system to assess bus speed and safety, coupled with a GPS system using the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time bus location information for passengers.
